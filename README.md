![Tests](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-action-examples/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains minimal, runnable examples of [Aerie actions](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/sequencing/actions/).  
Use them as references or starting points for building your own actions.

For more about actions and how they fit into the Aerie system, see the [Aerie docs](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/sequencing/actions/).
